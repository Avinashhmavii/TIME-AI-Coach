## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: HSL 210, 67%, 46% (RGB hex #3A8BCD), a professional, calming blue for credibility.
- Background color: HSL 210, 20%, 95% (RGB hex #F0F4F7), a very light blue to keep focus on the content.
- Accent color: HSL 180, 53%, 40% (RGB hex #32A89D), a teal-leaning color that subtly signals growth.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines and shorter blocks of text. Body font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for longer blocks of text, chosen for its readability.
- Use a set of modern, professional icons. For areas like 'feedback', consider icons showing ratings or progress.
- A clean, structured layout. Use whitespace effectively to prevent a cluttered feel and enhance readability.
- Subtle animations to provide feedback during interactions (e.g., loading states, transitions between interview stages). These should be used sparingly.
